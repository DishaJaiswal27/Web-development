With the help of nodejs and js, we create file system organizer.
It works on the basis of cmds , main cmd is 'pep'
pep tree ->> it return various file.
pep organizer ->> it organizes all the files.
pep help ->> it returns all the cmds.


In javascript, there is only single line string .
multiline string is not supported .
so we use object literal here (`    `); //see in main.js in helpFn.


###
copy file from one folder to another works as it create an empty file first and copy the content of that file.
copyFile function in node js work as same.

process.cwd() - current working directory
__dirname - current working directory 
both are same cwd and __dirname.
