let and const
1. Temporal dead zone
2. block and scope
3. variable shadowing
4. var/let/const


In es6, let and const are declared.
before es6 only var is used to declare variable.
var has many backdraws like it is fucntion scoped, it can be declared one than 
one time with same name.. etc etc.
To deal with this, let and const are introduced.
