Javascript runs on execution context .
execution context is a wrapper which helps js to runs in it and provide functionality
execution context provides 3 things : -
1 global
2 this 
3 code

the value of global in browser is window and this is window
the value of global in nodejs is global and this is {}

code provides hoisting facility which is assigning memory to the variable and functions.
their is one more thing that is global execution context.. for fucntions.
